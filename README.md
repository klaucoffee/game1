# Developing a Math Game for Kids - Math Keeper

## Project Overview
Math Keeper is a game targeted at children from ages 5 to 8 (this is the typical age where students learn mathematical operations at home and in school).

## Technologies Used
- jQuery
- javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Kaboom.js

### Approach Taken
The game mechanics of Math Keeper are built using functions in the Kaboom library (version 0.5.0) and javascript.

The Welcome page is designed with CSS.

The drop-down form, start and restart buttons make use of jQuery.

Sprites are self-drawn (60x60 px)

There are 5 levels to the game, from level 0 to level 4. Each level map is designed differently. In levels 0 and 1, the numbers are arranged in ascending order. From levels 2 to 4, the numbers are not arranged in any particular order and are distributed all over the gameplay area.

As the player gets to the higher levels, the enemies' movements are different, and the speed of the enemies increases.

Tip 2: Collect the numbers in the right sequence to make the equation correct. If your answer is wrong, you will have to restart the game and try again\(Psst...don't give up! Keep trying!)
